                    They try to serve the south Indian food in the most authentic form. The place looks soo culturally
                    rich with the fresh garland decoration which they change every morning. It opens around 6:30 am with
                    people already waiting to eat their delicious snacks and many more things. Not just this it also
                    serves one of the best filter coffee in town. All the food which is served is made at the same time
                    after the order is made so that their customers can relish on scrumptious hot food.
                    KT Coffee shop is extremely particular about the freshness of foods; so much so that Kamali mentions
                    none of her outlets have refrigerators.

                    The KT Coffee Shop was founded by Kamali palanivelu in 2021.
                    When asked about the cafe’s origin story, kamali told us that from her time Chennai as a
                    postgraduate student, she envisioned bringing traditional South Indian cuisine to the limelight with
                    consistent quality and service; the same way global chain restaurants like KFC and McDonalds were
                    able to.In order to maintain consistency across all chains, Kamali have strict regulations on food
                    quality and choice of ingredients. For example, the usage of baking soda in foods is a strict no.
                    They only use pure ghee, rather than mix it with oil.There’s no artificial colouring or flavouring
                    in any of the recipes, allowing consistency and high quality in every menu item.
